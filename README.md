# Card Game - Suit Collection

A strategic card game built in Unity where players and AI opponents take turns drawing and discarding cards with the goal of collecting cards of the same suit.

## Game Overview

In this card game, players compete against an AI opponent to be the first to collect a hand entirely of the same suit. The game features two modes: 3-card mode or 6-card mode, providing different levels of complexity and strategy.

## How to Play

### Objective
- Be the first to collect all cards of the same suit in your hand.
- If the deck runs out before anyone achieves this, the player with the lowest total card value wins.

### Game Modes
- **3-Card Mode**: Each player holds 3 cards arranged in a single row.
- **6-Card Mode**: Each player holds 6 cards arranged in a 3Ã—2 grid.

### Game Flow
1. At the start of the game, each player is dealt their initial hand (3 or 6 cards depending on the selected mode).
2. Players take turns to:
   - Discard one card from their hand to the discard pile
   - Draw a new card from the deck
3. The game continues until one player collects all cards of the same suit or the deck runs out.

## Strategic Elements

### Player Strategy
- Monitor your hand for suits that are appearing more frequently
- Consider which suits are being discarded by the AI
- Try to collect cards of a single suit while discarding cards of other suits

### AI Strategy
The AI uses a sophisticated decision-making process:

1. **Suit Analysis**: The AI evaluates both its hand and the discard pile to understand suit distribution.
2. **Potential Calculation**: For each suit in its hand, the AI calculates a "potential score" based on:
   - How many cards of that suit it already holds
   - How many cards of that suit have been discarded (fewer discards = higher potential)
3. **Decision Making**: 
   - Primary strategy: Discard cards from the suit with the lowest potential score
   - Fallback strategy: Discard from the suit with the fewest cards in hand
   - Ultimate fallback: Discard the first card in hand

## Technical Implementation

### Key Features
- **Animated Card Movements**: Smooth transitions using DOTween for card movements and transforms
- **Dynamic Card Layouts**: Automatically arranges cards based on the selected game mode
- **Robust Turn Management**: Prevents action during animations and maintains proper game flow
- **Win Condition Detection**: Continuously checks for winning conditions after each card draw
- **UI Animations**: Animated transitions for end game messages and restart options

### Code Architecture
- **Game Controller**: Manages game flow, card actions, and win conditions
- **GameMode**: Static class that maintains game settings across scenes
- **Level Loader**: Handles scene transitions and game mode selection
- **Card**: Individual card behavior and interaction

## Development
The game was developed in Unity with C# and features:
- Clean, well-organized code with logical grouping of related functions
- Extensive error prevention with state flags and condition checks
- Visually appealing card animations and transitions
- Intelligent AI opponent with multiple fallback strategies
